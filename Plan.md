# Step 1

- use nodejs, provide a `package.json` running `src/app.js`
- copy the `media_source/` images to `media_destination/`, preserve the file name, set the extension based on the `media` JSON catalogue
- supply `Readme.md` with installation and run instructions

# Step 2

- provide an HTML to showcase the processed images;
- use shadcn components to display the contents;
- display as Anki cards, for IDs in pairs: even on top, odd on bottom. E.g. first card top is image `0`, bottom image `1`. Second card top image `2`, bottom image `3`. And so on;
